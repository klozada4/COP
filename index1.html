<h1>Kayla Lozada</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Kayla Lozada and I am an <em>A.S. Computer Tech</em> major going to
Valencia College. Currently, I am planning to finish my degree in Summer 2026, and then apply 
for programs to be an MRI tech. I decided to be an MRI tech and work in the hospital after my mom and aunt encouraged me
to do this finally. I love to computer science and learning how it works, and being an MRI tech you most
definitely need to know some computer science. Hopefully, these next two semesters are a <strong>breeze</strong>!  </p>

<p>My favorite hobbies currently are sewing and video games. I learned to sew during COVID when I 
decided to try something new. I also used my sewing machine for my final senior project in highschool,
where I sewed a shirt from scratch (it didn't turn out as I liked, but I did get an A). Some video games
I like to play are Roblox and Call of Duty. Very different vibes, but I play both on my PS5 when I have the time to.
