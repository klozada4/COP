<h1>Adopting a Pet</h1>
<p>By choosing to adopt from an animal shelter, you give a second chance to a deserving pet and contribute to the welfare of animals in need. 
But it's not only the deep sense of fulfillment that comes from giving a home to an animal in need. 
The happiness and bond between a shelter pet and its adopter is truly special.</p>

<h2><a name="why"></a>Why should I adopt?</h2>
<p>Many ask, why should I adopt? You provide a second chance to a deserving animal who can easily give
you the upmost love and loyalty. You also alleviate shelter overcrowding, freeing up space for another animal thatmay be in need. 
Most animal shelters operate on limited budgets and rely heavily on donations. Adoption fees can help cover their expenses. 
By adopting from a shelter, you are providing financial support that enables them to continue their rescue and rehoming efforts. </p>

<h2><a name="buy"></a>Why not buy?</h2>
<p>Throughout the country, thousands of commercial pet-breeding facilities and backyard breeders produce millions of animals for sale in pet stores and through website or newspaper ads. 
Often known as puppy and kitten mills, these facilities repeatedly impregnate female animals like dogs that spend their entire lives locked up in cages without human companionship. 
These animals are often in intolerable environments, forced to produce litter upon litter, and are destroyed after they become unprofitable assets. Some breeders even kill off those females
that are no longer able to produce for them. Adopting a shelter animal means you donâ€™t support such cruel practices.
</p>

<h2><a name="where"></a>Where can I adopt?</h2>
<p> Anyone can easily look up a shelter that is local to them and see when they are open. However, some shelters require an appointment
for adoption viewing. It would be best to call and find out information on your local shelter and the adoption process behind them. You can go 
on Google Maps, for example, and just search up "Shelters near me", where a list will pop up for you. Happy adopting!
