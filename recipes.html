	 <h1>My Own Receipe - The Best Mac & Cheese</h1>
	 <!-- Intro Paragraph with required tags -->
	  <p>I have conjured up this recipe from my mom's own recipe and a website called
	 <a href="https://www.sweetteaandthyme.com/southern-baked-macaroni-cheese-soul-food/">
			 <cite>Sweet Tea and Thyme</cite>
		</a> by Eden Westbrook. I've always been fond of mac&cheese since young, as it is
		a staple for kids. However, I only knew of Kraft mac&cheese, or the soggy soupy slop. My mom
		knew I was a picky kid, so she never thought to make it in a soul food way. But the 1<sup>st</sup> ever time
		I had it officially at my friend's house, I was in <strong>love</strong>. It opened up my 
		<em>very</em> picky taste buds.</p>
		
	<p> As my friend Tiffany once said: 
	<q>Good mac and cheese is like a warm hug on a plate.</q></p>

	 <!-- Instructions Section -->
	 <h2><a name="instructions"></a>Instructions:</h2>
	  <ol>
	   <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC). 
	   Butter an 8-by-11 or 9-by-13-inch baking dish and set aside.</li>
	   <li>Fill a large stockpot or dutch oven halfway with chicken broth (or water and 1 tablespoon salt if you don't have broth), 
	   and bring to a boil. Add in elbow macaroni and cook until just under al dente, according to package directions. 
	   Do not fully cook or overcook the macaroni pasta, it'll finish cooking through completely in the oven. 
	   Once just under al dente, drain the pasta.</li>
	   <li>While the pasta boils, use a wooden spoon to mix the half and half, heavy cream, <strong>half of the cheddar cheese, 
	   half of the Colby jack cheese</strong>, all of the mozzarella cheese, all of the American cheese, 
	   and all of the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl.</li>
	   <li>Add smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and some kosher salt and pepper, stirring well and tasting the mixture to ensure there is a <em>good flavor</em>. 
	   Do not add too much salt, since cheese is pretty salty and will add its saltiness as it bakes. 
	   Once satisfied with the seasoning, stir in the cooked macaroni and eggs until well incorporated with the cheese.</li>
	   <li>Pour the macaroni mixture into the baking dish and spread evenly.</li>
	   <li>Top the macaroni and cheese generously with the rest of the cheddar cheese and colby jack cheese. 
	   Sprinkle the top with a little more smoked paprika, if desired.</li>
	   <li>Bake the mac and cheese for 35 minutes or until the cheese crust is bubbly and nicely browned. 
	   Do not over-bake or the macaroni pasta will become mushy and the cheese mixture will become dry.</li>
	   <li>Let the baked macaroni and cheese cool for about 5 minutes or until just cool enough to serve. 
	   Serve hot so the cheese is nice and creamy.</li>
	  </ol>
